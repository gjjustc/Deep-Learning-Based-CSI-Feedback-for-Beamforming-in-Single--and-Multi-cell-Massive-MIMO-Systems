# Deep Learning-Based CSI Feedback for Beamforming in Single- and Multi-cell Massive MIMO Systems （Jiajia Guo ， Chao-Kai Wen， Shi Jin）
This paper has been accepted by IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications. 

In the public version of this paper in IEEE Xplore, Eq. (15) should be N_{FC} = Ox(I+1) rather than N_{FC} = 2Ox(I+1). However, the parameter number and the FLOPs number in that version are right. Sorry for this typo.
